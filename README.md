Overview of Verilog Logic Gates Project
Objective
The objective of this project is to have basic digital logic circuits designed, implemented, and simulated using Verilog hardware description language (HDL) and ModelSim simulation software. A comprehensive understanding of digital logic design is aimed to be provided, including the creation of various logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) and combinational circuits (such as adders and multiplexers). By the end of the project, the functionality of these circuits is to be verified through simulation and waveform analysis.

Key Activities
Learning Verilog HDL:

The syntax and semantics of Verilog are to be understood.

Testbenches:

Each module is to have an associated testbench to verify its functionality.
Testbenches are to apply various input combinations and check outputs.
$display statements are to be used to print results to the console.
Waveform viewers in ModelSim are to be used for visual verification.
Skills and Tools Used
Verilog HDL:

Writing of syntactically correct and efficient Verilog code is to be done.
An understanding of basic digital logic and combinational circuit design is to be demonstrated.
ModelSim:

Project Summary
This project demonstrates the ability to design and implement digital logic circuits using Verilog HDL. The designs are validated through simulation in ModelSim to confirm the correct operation of basic logic gates and more complex combinational circuits. Hands-on experience is gained from writing testbenches and analyzing waveforms, developing a solid foundation in digital design and simulation.
